EXPERIMENT 5 — F-Measure & E-Measure
🧠 Aim
To implement a program that calculates Harmonic Mean (F-Measure) and E-Measure for evaluating the performance of an Information Retrieval (IR) system.

🎯 Objectives
To understand how to combine Precision and Recall into a single evaluation metric.
To study how E-measure allows adjusting importance between precision and recall.
To learn practical evaluation methods used in modern IR systems (like search engines).

🧩 Background Context
In the previous experiment, we saw two metrics:
Precision (P) → measures quality of retrieved documents.
Recall (R) → measures completeness of retrieval.
But using both separately can be confusing.
→ For example: System A = (P=0.8, R=0.3), System B = (P=0.5, R=0.6).
Which is better? 🤔

To solve this, we use combined measures that capture both aspects at once.

⚖️ 1️⃣ F-Measure (Harmonic Mean of Precision & Recall)
Definition
The F-measure (or F1-Score) is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall:
F = 2PR / P+R
It gives a single number representing balance between precision and recall.
Why Harmonic Mean (not Arithmetic)?
Because the harmonic mean penalizes large differences —
if either precision or recall is very low, F becomes low.

Example:
If P = 1.0 and R = 0.0 →
F = 0.
(You can’t have a good system if one of them is zero!)

Interpretation
Precision	Recall	F-Measure	Meaning
1.0		1.0	1.0		Perfect system
0.8		0.8	0.8		Balanced & good
0.9		0.4	0.55		Imbalanced system
0.4		0.9	0.55		Same F → equally poor balance
F emphasizes both completeness and accuracy.

Formula Variants
Sometimes a weighted F-measure is used:	​
β > 1 → more weight to recall
β < 1 → more weight to precision

Example:
F₂ → recall is twice as important as precision.

✅ F = 0.583 → System is moderately good, but can improve recall.

Algorithm Steps
Input precision and recall.
Compute 
F=2PR/(P+R).
Display result.

💻 Python-style Implementation
# Input values
precision = float(input("Enter Precision: "))
recall = float(input("Enter Recall: "))

# F-Measure formula
f_measure = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)

print("F-Measure =", round(f_measure, 3))

🧮 2️⃣ E-Measure (Van Rijsbergen’s Metric)

The E-measure is a more flexible version of F, proposed by C. J. Van Rijsbergen.

Definition
Simplified relationship:
For β = 1 → E = 1 − F
So E acts as the complement of F when both are equally weighted.
Role of β
β > 1 → prioritize precision
β < 1 → prioritize recall
β = 1 → balance (equal weight)

Interpretation Table
β value	Focus				Relation to F
β = 1	Equal weight			E = 1 – F
β > 1	Precision more important	E depends more on 1/P
β < 1	Recall more important		E depends more on 1/R
⚙️ Example

If
P = 0.7, R = 0.5, β = 1
F=0.583
E=1−0.583=0.417

✅ Interpretation: E represents the error rate (smaller E → better system).

💻 Python-style Code
# Input precision, recall, beta
precision = 0.7
recall = 0.5
beta = 1

# Calculate F
F = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)
# Calculate E
E = 1 - F if beta == 1 else None  # simplified for beta=1 case

print("F-Measure =", round(F,3))
print("E-Measure =", round(E,3))

📊 Comparison Between Precision, Recall, F & E
Metric	Focus	Ideal Value	Range	Interpretation
Precision	Accuracy	High	0–1	% of retrieved docs that are relevant
Recall	Completeness	High	0–1	% of relevant docs retrieved
F-Measure	Balance	High	0–1	Harmonic mean of P & R
E-Measure	Error measure	Low	0–1	Complement of F when β=1


----------------------------------QNA-----------------------------------------

1. F-Measure: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two into a single metric.
2. Harmonic vs Arithmetic Mean: The harmonic mean penalizes extreme differences between precision and
recall, ensuring both must be high for a good score.
3. in Fß (or E-measure): weights the importance of recall relative to precision (P > 1 favors recall, < 1
favors precision).
4. Relationship (F & E): E-measure is derived as E = 1 — F; hence, they are complementary.
5. High F value: Indicates both precision and recall are high — good overall model performance.
6. Low E value: Also indicates high precision and recall (since E = 1 — F).
7. When precision or recall = O: F becomes O, as harmonic mean collapses to zero.
8. Units of F and E: Both are dimensionless (unitless) and range between 0 and 1.
