EXPERIMENT 6 — Feature Extraction in 2D Color Images
🧠 Aim
To extract features (such as color, texture, shape, size, etc.) from a 2D color image, and visualize them using a histogram.

🎯 Objective
To understand what features mean in the context of images.
To learn how images can be represented numerically for retrieval or classification.
To implement basic feature extraction using Python and visualize them.

🧩 Background Context
Images are not directly comparable like text or numbers — we need to describe them using quantitative values.
For example, a “red rose” and “red apple” share a color feature (red), but differ in shape and texture.
So, before comparing or retrieving images, we convert them into feature vectors — a compact numerical representation.
This process is called Feature Extraction.

🔍 1️⃣ What are Features?
Features are measurable properties that capture essential visual information about an image.
Type	Description	Example
Color features		Represent the color composition	Mean RGB, color histogram
Texture features	Represent spatial arrangement of pixel intensities	Contrast, entropy, homogeneity
Shape features		Represent object boundaries and geometry	Area, perimeter, aspect ratio
Statistical features	Derived using math formulas	Mean, variance, standard deviation

🧩 2️⃣ Feature Types Explained
(a) Color Features
Most basic and widely used.
Represented using histograms of pixel intensities in RGB, HSV, or YCbCr color spaces.
Easy to compute and rotation/scale independent.
Example:
An image dominated by red pixels will have a high count in the red channel histogram.

(b) Texture Features
Define surface properties like smoothness, roughness, or regularity.
Extracted using GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix).
Common texture features:

(c) Shape Features
Capture object outlines or boundaries.
Typically derived from binary images after segmentation.
Metrics: Area, Perimeter, Eccentricity, Aspect ratio.

(d) Statistical Features
Derived from pixel intensity distributions.
	​
🧮 3️⃣ Mathematical Representation (for Texture)
The GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) is the most important method.
It’s a matrix where element (i,j) represents how often a pixel with intensity i is adjacent to a pixel with intensity j.
It depends on:
Distance (d) between pixels
Angle (θ): 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°
From this, we derive features like contrast, energy, etc.

⚙️ 4️⃣ Step-by-Step Implementation (Python)
Let’s use cv2 (OpenCV), skimage.feature, and matplotlib.
import cv2
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from skimage.feature import greycomatrix, greycoprops

# Step 1: Read image
img = cv2.imread('flower.jpg')
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Step 2: Plot color histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))
color = ('b','g','r')
for i,col in enumerate(color):
    hist = cv2.calcHist([img],[i],None,[256],[0,256])
    plt.plot(hist, color = col)
plt.title("Color Histogram")
plt.xlabel("Pixel Intensity")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()

# Step 3: Compute GLCM matrix (distance=1, angle=0)
glcm = greycomatrix(gray, [1], [0], 256, symmetric=True, normed=True)

# Step 4: Extract texture features
contrast = greycoprops(glcm, 'contrast')[0,0]
energy = greycoprops(glcm, 'energy')[0,0]
homogeneity = greycoprops(glcm, 'homogeneity')[0,0]

print("Contrast:", contrast)
print("Energy:", energy)
print("Homogeneity:", homogeneity)

🧩 5️⃣ Observations
After running this:
You’ll see three overlapping histograms (B, G, R) representing pixel intensity distributions.
The feature values (contrast, energy, etc.) will show how smooth or detailed the image is.

Feature			Interpretation
High energy		Smooth or plain image
High contrast		Image has strong edges
High entropy		Complex image
High homogeneity	Uniform texture

6️⃣ Applications
Field								Use

Medical Imaging					Classify tissue types
Quality Inspection					Detect surface defects
Biometrics						Face, fingerprint recognition
Remote Sensing					Terrain and vegetation analysis

🎤 7️⃣ Viva Questions (With Detailed Answers)
No.	Question	Answer
1	What is feature extraction?	Process of converting raw image data into numerical descriptors (features) that represent important properties like color, texture, or shape.
2	Why is feature extraction necessary?	Because raw images are high-dimensional and hard to compare directly. Features make similarity search and classification computationally efficient.
3	What are color features?	Features that represent distribution of colors in the image, typically through histograms in RGB or HSV space.
4	Define texture features.	Describe spatial arrangement of pixel intensities (patterns of smoothness or roughness) using statistical measures like contrast, entropy, energy.
5	What is GLCM?	Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix — represents frequency of intensity pairs (i, j) in an image at a specific distance and direction.
6	What are GLCM-based features?	Contrast, Energy, Homogeneity, Correlation, Entropy.
7	Difference between energy and entropy.	Energy = uniformity (lower randomness), Entropy = randomness (higher disorder).
8	What is a color histogram?	Graph showing frequency of pixel intensities for each color channel (R, G, B).
9	What is shape feature extraction?	Describes geometric properties like object boundaries, area, and perimeter.
10	Application of feature extraction?	Image classification, object detection, pattern recognition, CBIR.
