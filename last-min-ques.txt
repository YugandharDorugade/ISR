1️⃣ What is Information Retrieval (IR)?
IR is the process of finding relevant information or documents from a large collection based on a user’s query.

2️⃣ What is an index in IR systems?
An index is a data structure that maps terms to document locations for faster searching, like a book index.

3️⃣ What is an Inverted Index?
It stores each term along with a list of documents where it appears — enabling fast keyword-based retrieval.

4️⃣ What is a Vocabulary and Posting List?
Vocabulary = unique words; Posting list = document IDs where those words occur.

5️⃣ What is the purpose of text preprocessing in IR?
To clean and normalize text (remove stop words, stemming, case-folding) before indexing or retrieval.

6️⃣ What is stemming or conflation?
It reduces words to their root form, e.g., “playing”, “played” → “play”, to handle word variations uniformly.

7️⃣ What is Single Pass Clustering (SPC)?
A fast document clustering algorithm that assigns each document to the most similar cluster in a single scan.

8️⃣ What is the advantage of SPC?
It’s efficient for large data and does not require reprocessing like k-means — works in one pass.

9️⃣ Define Precision.
Precision = relevant retrieved / total retrieved → measures accuracy of the retrieved results.

10️⃣ Define Recall.
Recall = relevant retrieved / total relevant → measures completeness of retrieval.

11️⃣ What is the trade-off between Precision and Recall?
Increasing recall usually lowers precision — a good IR system balances both.

12️⃣ Define F-Measure.
It is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, giving a single score for IR performance.

13️⃣ Define E-Measure.
An error-based measure; for β=1, E = 1 – F, showing the complement of the F-score.

14️⃣ What is the role of β in Fβ or Eβ?
β controls whether recall (β>1) or precision (β<1) is given more importance.

15️⃣ What is feature extraction in images?
It converts visual information into numeric features like color, texture, and shape for comparison.

16️⃣ What is a color histogram?
A graph showing frequency of pixel intensities for each color channel (R, G, B) in an image.

17️⃣ What is a GLCM?
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix — represents how often pairs of pixel intensities occur together in an image.

18️⃣ List common texture features derived from GLCM.
Contrast, Energy, Entropy, Homogeneity, and Correlation.

19️⃣ What is a web crawler?
A program that automatically fetches and parses web pages to collect data or links for indexing.

20️⃣ What is robots.txt?
A website file that specifies which pages a crawler is allowed or disallowed to access.

21️⃣ What are the main components of a web crawler?
Seed URL, Fetcher, Parser, URL Queue, and Indexer.

22️⃣ What is an API?
API (Application Programming Interface) is a service that allows communication and data exchange between systems.

23️⃣ What is OpenWeatherMap API used for?
To retrieve real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) in JSON format.

24️⃣ What is JSON?
JavaScript Object Notation — a lightweight, human-readable format for exchanging structured data.

25️⃣ What is a Recommender System?
A system that predicts user preferences and suggests items like movies, products, or songs.

26️⃣ What are the types of Recommender Systems?
Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering, and Hybrid.

27️⃣ What is Content-Based Filtering?
Recommends items similar to those the user liked, based on item features (e.g., genre, keywords).

28️⃣ What is Collaborative Filtering?
Recommends items liked by users with similar tastes — based on user–item interactions.

29️⃣ What is the cold start problem?
The difficulty in recommending new items or for new users with insufficient data.

30️⃣ Give some real-life examples of recommender systems.
Netflix (movies), Amazon (products), Spotify (songs), YouTube (videos), Flipkart (shopping).
