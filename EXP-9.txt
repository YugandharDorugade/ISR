EXPERIMENT 9 — Recommender System (Case Study)
🧠 Aim
To study and understand the working of Recommender Systems through a case study — such as movie, product, music, or doctor recommendation.

🎯 Objectives
To understand how systems predict user preferences automatically.
To study Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid recommendation approaches.
To analyze a simple example showing how recommendations are generated.

🧩 1️⃣ What is a Recommender System?
A Recommender System is an intelligent software tool that predicts what a user may like or prefer based on:
Their past behavior (what they viewed, bought, rated),
Or similar users’ preferences.
📘 Example:
Netflix → recommends movies.
Amazon → recommends products.
Spotify → recommends songs.
YouTube → recommends videos.
In short, it’s an Information Retrieval system that retrieves personalized information instead of documents.

🧩 2️⃣ Types of Recommender Systems
Type	Working Principle		Example
1. Content-Based Filtering	Recommends items similar to what the user liked before, based on item features (genre, keywords, etc.)	Netflix showing movies similar to ones you watched
2. Collaborative Filtering		Finds users similar to you and recommends what they liked	Amazon: “Users who bought this also bought…”
3. Hybrid Approach	Combines both above methods to improve accuracy	Spotify, YouTube, LinkedIn

🧩 3️⃣ Content-Based Filtering (CBF)
Uses features of items (e.g., genre, description, author).
The system builds a profile of the user’s interests.
Then recommends new items with similar content.

Example:
Movie			Features			User Likes
Inception			Sci-Fi, Thriller		✅
Interstellar	Sci-Fi, Drama	✅
Avengers	Action, Sci-Fi	✅
La La Land	Romance, Drama	❌
System learns user likes “Sci-Fi” → recommends “The Martian”, “Gravity”, etc.

Techniques Used:
TF-IDF vectors (for text-based features)
Cosine similarity
Cosine similarity formula:
similarity (A,B) = ∣∣A∣∣×∣∣B∣∣ / A⋅B
	​
🧩 4️⃣ Collaborative Filtering (CF)
Recommends items based on similar users instead of item features.
Two types:
User–User CF → “Find users like me.”
Item–Item CF → “Find items liked by users who liked similar items.”
User–User Example:

User	Movie A	Movie B	Movie C	Movie D
Alice	5	4	0	0
Bob	5	0	4	0
Carol	0	5	4	0
→ Alice and Bob both rated A highly → Bob liked C → recommend C to Alice.

Mathematical Approach:
Represent ratings as a matrix.
Compute similarity between users or items using:
Cosine similarity
Pearson correlation

🧩 5️⃣ Hybrid Recommender System
Combines CBF + CF for better results.
System	Hybrid Approach
Netflix	Combines movie content + user viewing patterns
Spotify	Uses collaborative filtering + audio feature extraction
Amazon	Mixes user behavior + product metadata

Advantages:
Reduces cold start problem.
Gives more accurate and diverse results.

⚙️ 6️⃣ Algorithmic Overview (Simple Logic)
# Example: Simple content-based recommender using cosine similarity

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Step 1: Dataset
movies = [
    "Inception sci-fi thriller dream",
    "Interstellar sci-fi space drama",
    "Avengers action sci-fi heroes",
    "La La Land romance drama music"
]

# Step 2: TF-IDF Vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(movies)

# Step 3: Compute cosine similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)

# Step 4: Print similar movies
movie_index = 0  # Inception
print("Movies similar to:", movies[movie_index])
for i in range(len(movies)):
    if i != movie_index:
        print(f"  {movies[i]} → Similarity: {round(similarity[movie_index][i], 2)}")


Output Example:

Movies similar to: Inception sci-fi thriller dream
  Interstellar sci-fi space drama → Similarity: 0.58
  Avengers action sci-fi heroes → Similarity: 0.41
  La La Land romance drama music → Similarity: 0.02


✅ System recommends Interstellar first — most similar to Inception.


🧩 7️⃣ Real-World Applications
Field			Application
E-commerce	Product recommendations (Amazon, Flipkart)
Entertainment	Movie/music suggestions (Netflix, Spotify)
Healthcare	Doctor/drug recommendation systems
Education		Course recommendation platforms
Social Media	Friend and content recommendations


⚖️ 8️⃣ Advantages & Limitations
Advantages				Limitations
Improves user experience	Cold start problem (new users/items)
Increases engagement		Data sparsity (too many missing ratings)
Supports personalization		Privacy and scalability issues
Helps business conversions	Biased recommendations if data is limited

-------------QNA--------------
No.	Question												Answer
1	What is a recommender system?							It’s an intelligent system that predicts user preferences and recommends items accordingly.
2	What are the two main types?								Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.
3	Define Content-Based Filtering.							Recommends items based on similarity of features to items the user already liked.
4	Define Collaborative Filtering.								Recommends items liked by similar users, based on user-item interactions.
5	What is the cold start problem?							Difficulty in making recommendations for new users or new items with no data.
6	What is cosine similarity used for?							To measure how similar two vectors (items or users) are, based on their feature representation.
7	What is a hybrid recommender system?						A system that combines collaborative and content-based methods for higher accuracy.
8	What are real-world examples of recommender systems?		Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Spotify, Flipkart.
9	What is the role of machine learning in recommender systems?	ML models learn patterns from past data to predict user preferences.
10	Why are recommender systems important?					They personalize the user experience, increase engagement, and improve sales or retention.
