EXPERIMENT 8 — Weather Report Using Python
🧠 Aim
To implement a Python program that retrieves live weather information (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, etc.) for a given city using an API.

🎯 Objectives
To understand what APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are and how they enable real-time data access.
To learn how to fetch JSON data from a web server.
To build a simple Python-based information retrieval system using live weather data.

🧩 1️⃣ Background: What is an API?
An API is a communication bridge between two software systems.
It allows a program to request information from another service.
The service sends back data in structured format (usually JSON).

📘 Example:
When you open a weather app, it calls an API like
api.openweathermap.org to fetch live data for your city.

⚙️ 2️⃣ OpenWeatherMap API
We’ll use the OpenWeatherMap API — a free and popular weather service.
Base URL:
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={CITY}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric
Parameter	Meaning
q		City name (e.g., Pune, Mumbai)
appid		Your unique API key
units		Metric → Celsius (optional)

💡 3️⃣ How It Works
User inputs city name.
Python script sends an HTTP GET request to the weather API.
API returns a JSON object containing all details.
Script extracts and displays required fields.

🧮 4️⃣ Data Format (Sample JSON Output)
{
  "coord": {"lon": 73.85, "lat": 18.52},
  "weather": [{"description": "clear sky"}],
  "main": {
      "temp": 28.5,
      "pressure": 1013,
      "humidity": 64
  },
  "wind": {"speed": 2.1},
  "name": "Pune"
}

We’ll extract:
City name
Temperature
Humidity
Pressure
Weather description
Wind speed

💻 5️⃣ Python Code Implementation
import requests  # Library to make web requests

# Step 1: User input
city = input("Enter city name: ")

# Step 2: API details
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"  # (You can get a free one from openweathermap.org)
base_url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

# Step 3: Make API call
url = f"{base_url}?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()  # Convert JSON to Python dictionary

# Step 4: Extract and print data
if data["cod"] == 200:
    print(f"\nWeather Report for {data['name']}:")
    print("Temperature:", data["main"]["temp"], "°C")
    print("Humidity:", data["main"]["humidity"], "%")
    print("Pressure:", data["main"]["pressure"], "hPa")
    print("Wind Speed:", data["wind"]["speed"], "m/s")
    print("Description:", data["weather"][0]["description"])
else:
    print("City not found or API error.")

🧩 Output Example:
Enter city name: Pune

Weather Report for Pune:
Temperature: 28.5 °C
Humidity: 64 %
Pressure: 1013 hPa
Wind Speed: 2.1 m/s
Description: clear sky
✅ The program retrieves live, real-time data from the API and displays it neatly.

🧱 6️⃣ How It Relates to IR (Information Retrieval)
This experiment is actually a real-world IR application —
Instead of retrieving documents, we’re retrieving structured data (weather info) based on a query (city name).

IR Concept		Weather App Equivalent
Query			City name entered by user
Document collection	Global weather database
Retrieval model		API request (HTTP GET)
Result set		JSON data returned
Output			Weather summary printed

🧩 7️⃣ Error Handling (Optional Improvement)
Add exception handling for bad inputs or network issues:

try:
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
except Exception as e:
    print("Error fetching data:", e)

🧰 8️⃣ Applications
Field						Example
Weather forecasting apps	AccuWeather, Weather Channel
Smart home automation		Adjusting AC/fan based on temperature
Agriculture				Crop planning based on rainfall or humidity
Travel apps				Suggesting destinations with pleasant weather
Disaster management		Predicting storms, rainfall alerts


--------------QNA-----------------------------------------
No.		Question															Answer
1		What is an API?													API (Application Programming Interface) is a software interface that allows communication between two applications.
2		What type of API is OpenWeatherMap?									A REST API — it uses HTTP GET requests and returns JSON data.
3	What is JSON?						    	JavaScript Object Notation — lightweight data format used for data exchange between client and server.
4	Why use the requests library in Python?				To send HTTP requests and receive responses easily.
5	What does the parameter units=metric do?			It displays temperature in Celsius instead of Kelvin.
6	What happens if the city name is invalid?			API returns an error code (like 404), which can be handled in the program.
7	What is appid in the URL?					Your unique API key used to authenticate requests.
8	What is the significance of weather APIs in IR systems?		They demonstrate real-time data retrieval based on user queries — a form of information retrieval.
9	Why is error handling important in API calls?			To manage issues like invalid URLs, bad responses, or network failures gracefully.
10	Can APIs return data formats other than JSON?			Yes, many APIs also support XML or plain text, depending on user preference.
