EXPERIMENT 2 — Single Pass Algorithm for Clustering
🧠 Aim
To implement the Single Pass Algorithm for clustering documents.

🎯 Objectives
Understand the concept of clustering in Information Retrieval (IR).
Learn how single pass (online) clustering works.
Analyze the effect of similarity thresholds on the number and quality of clusters.

🧩 Core Theory
1️⃣ What is Clustering?
Clustering = grouping similar objects (or documents) together so that:
Within-cluster similarity is high (documents inside a cluster are similar),
Between-cluster similarity is low (documents from different clusters are dissimilar).
Used in IR for:
Document organization
Topic grouping
Improving search results

2️⃣ Cluster Hypothesis
“Documents that are similar to each other tend to be relevant to the same information need.”

📘 Example:
If you search “machine learning”, documents discussing “neural networks”, “deep learning”, and “supervised learning” are likely to belong to the same cluster.

3️⃣ Types of Clustering
Type						Description
Hierarchical				Creates a tree of clusters (agglomerative/divisive).
Partitional					Divides data into fixed number of clusters (e.g., k-means).
Single Pass (Incremental)		Processes each document one by one; forms or updates clusters immediately.

4️⃣ Single Pass Algorithm (also called Online or Incremental Clustering)
Main Idea:
Documents are processed sequentially — each new document is either assigned to an existing cluster or starts a new one.

🧾 Steps of the Algorithm
Input: Minimum five conflated files (documents already processed by conflation algorithm).
Initialize: Create first cluster and make the first document its representative (centroid).
For each next document:
	Compute similarity (e.g., using Dice coefficient) with each existing cluster representative.
	If similarity ≥ threshold, assign it to that cluster.
	Else, create a new cluster with that document as representative.
Recompute representative: When a document joins a cluster, update the cluster’s representative.
Continue until all documents are processed.

📘 Output:
List of clusters with their member documents.

5️⃣ Important Terms
Term						Explanation
Cluster Representative / Centroid	A summary of all objects in the cluster (like an average vector).
Matching Function				Measures similarity between document and centroid (e.g., Dice, Cosine).
Threshold (T)					Minimum similarity required to join a cluster. Higher T = more clusters. Lower T = fewer clusters.

6️⃣ Example
Let’s say we have 3 document vectors (simplified):
D1: [1, 0, 1, 0]
D2: [1, 1, 0, 0]
D3: [0, 1, 1, 0]
Threshold = 0.5
D1 forms Cluster 1.
D2 → similarity(D1,D2)=0.5 → joins Cluster 1.
D3 → similarity with Cluster 1 < 0.5 → forms new Cluster 2.
So final:
Cluster 1: D1, D2
Cluster 2: D3

7️⃣ Dice Coefficient (Similarity Measure)
Used to measure overlap between two sets (or word lists).
Dice(A,B)=∣A∣+∣B∣ / 2∣A∩B∣
	​
Ranges between 0 and 1:
1 → identical documents
0 → completely different

⚙️ Pseudocode (Simplified)
# Input: List of documents with keywords
docs = [
    {"ai", "ml", "data"},
    {"machine", "learning", "data"},
    {"dog", "cat", "animal"}
]

clusters = []
threshold = 0.5

def dice(a, b):
    return 2 * len(a & b) / (len(a) + len(b))

for doc in docs:
    added = False
    for cluster in clusters:
        sim = dice(doc, cluster["rep"])
        if sim >= threshold:
            cluster["docs"].append(doc)
            # recompute representative
            cluster["rep"] = set().union(*cluster["docs"])
            added = True
            break
    if not added:
        clusters.append({"rep": doc, "docs": [doc]})

for i, c in enumerate(clusters):
    print(f"Cluster {i+1}:", c["docs"])

💬 Short Answer Questions
Q1. Explain clustering using dissimilarity matrix.
Ans:
A dissimilarity matrix stores pairwise distances (or 1 - similarity) between documents.
Clustering is then performed by grouping documents with small dissimilarity values.
The threshold controls whether documents are grouped or separated — higher threshold → more strict → more clusters.

Q2. Explain K-list.
Ans:
K-list is a structure used in clustering to maintain k most similar documents for each document.
It helps in reducing computation time by comparing only top-k related documents instead of all pairs.

Q3. Explain Cluster-based Retrieval.
Ans:
In cluster-based retrieval, instead of searching all documents individually, the query is first matched to cluster representatives.
Then, only documents inside the most relevant clusters are searched — saving time and improving relevance.

Q4. Working of Rocchio’s Algorithm.
Ans:
Rocchio’s algorithm is a relevance feedback method that updates a user’s query vector based on relevant and non-relevant documents.
Where
R: relevant docs, 
N: non-relevant docs
α, β, γ are tuning parameters

It shifts the query vector toward relevant documents and away from irrelevant ones.

🎤 Viva Questions (With Short Answers)
No.	Question				Short Answer
1	Cluster using similarity measures	Similarity measures (like Dice, Cosine, Jaccard) decide which documents go into same cluster.
2	IR Models				Boolean, Vector Space, and Probabilistic models.
3	Boolean Search				Uses logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to filter documents matching query exactly.
4	What is Multi-pass Clustering?		Unlike single-pass, multi-pass clustering revisits and refines clusters iteratively for better accuracy.
