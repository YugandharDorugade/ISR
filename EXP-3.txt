EXPERIMENT 3 — Inverted File
🧠 Aim
To implement a program for retrieval of documents using inverted files.

🎯 Objectives
Understand how indexing improves the speed of document retrieval.
Learn about inverted files, vocabulary, and occurrence lists.
Implement a simple version of inverted index-based search.

🧩 Core Theory
1️⃣ What is Indexing?
Indexing = creating a data structure that helps find relevant information quickly.
Instead of searching every word in every file (sequential search), we build an index mapping each term to the documents that contain it.

📘 Analogy:
Think of a book index — you don’t read the entire book to find “photosynthesis”; you look it up in the index.

2️⃣ Why Indexing is Needed
Sequential (linear) search = slow (O(n)) for large text collections.
Index = faster retrieval (logarithmic or constant time).
Especially important for large, semi-static text databases (like Wikipedia, research archives).

3️⃣ Inverted File Structure
An inverted file (or inverted index) is the most common indexing technique used in IR systems.
It has two main parts:
Part					Description
Vocabulary (Dictionary)	List of all unique words (terms) in the collection.
Occurrences (Postings)	For each word, list of all documents (and positions) where it appears.
📘 Example
Let’s say we have 3 documents:
Doc ID	Text
D1	“This is a text”
D2	“A text has words”
D3	“Words are made from letters”

After removing stop words and tokenizing:

Term	Occurrences (Doc IDs)
text	D1, D2
words	D2, D3
made	D3
letters	D3
This is the inverted index.

4️⃣ Search Steps Using Inverted File
When a user searches for “text words”, the process is:
Vocabulary Search:
Find the words “text” and “words” in the vocabulary.
Retrieve Occurrences:
“text” → {D1, D2}
“words” → {D2, D3}
Manipulate Occurrences:
For AND query → intersection → D2
For OR query → union → D1, D2, D3
So, document D2 is most relevant for “text AND words”.

5️⃣ Data Structures Used
Hashing: for fast lookup (O(1))
Trie / Tree: for prefix or range queries
B-tree: for sorted access (lexicographic order)

6️⃣ Algorithm (From Manual + Simplified)
# Step 1: Input text documents (already conflated)
docs = {
    "D1": "this is a text",
    "D2": "a text has words",
    "D3": "words are made from letters"
}

# Step 2: Build inverted index
index = {}
for doc, text in docs.items():
    for word in text.split():
        if word not in index:
            index[word] = set()
        index[word].add(doc)

# Step 3: Display index
print("Inverted Index:")
for term, occ in index.items():
    print(term, "→", occ)

# Step 4: Query search
query = input("Enter query: ").split()
results = [index.get(q, set()) for q in query]
final = set.intersection(*results)
print("Documents retrieved:", final)

7️⃣ Variants / Related Concepts
Concept					Description
Signature Files				Store hashed signatures (bit strings) instead of explicit lists; saves space but may produce false positives.
Suffix Arrays / Suffix Trees	Used for fast substring search (especially in DNA sequences, strings).
Block Addressing			Instead of word positions, store block IDs for faster but coarser retrieval.

8️⃣ Applications of Inverted Index
Search engines (Google, Bing)
Library catalog systems
Text mining and natural language processing
Database full-text search

💬 Short Answer Questions
Q1. Working of Inverted Files
Ans:
An inverted file maps each term (from the vocabulary) to a list of documents where it occurs (occurrence list).
Searching is done by looking up the query term in the index and retrieving all associated documents.

Q2. Applications of Inverted Index
Ans:
Used in:
Search engines
Document retrieval systems
Content-based filtering
Text mining

Q3. Working of Signature Files
Ans:
Each document is represented by a bit string (signature).
Each bit represents whether a term from a dictionary appears in the document.
Query signatures are compared with document signatures using bitwise operations — faster but may produce false hits.

🎤 Viva Questions (With Short Answers)
No.	Question	Short Answer
1	What is vocabulary and occurrences?	Vocabulary = list of unique terms; Occurrences = list of document IDs where each term appears.
2	How is search carried out on inverted index?	By finding query terms in the vocabulary, fetching their occurrence lists, and combining them (AND/OR).
3	How to index multimedia objects?	By extracting features (e.g., color histograms, shape descriptors, audio fingerprints) and indexing them like keywords.
4	Limitations of inverted index?	High storage overhead, frequent updates are costly, unsuitable for dynamic databases.
5	What is suffix array and suffix tree?	Both store suffixes of text for fast substring search; suffix tree is hierarchical, suffix array is space-efficient linear version.
6	What is the concept of signature files?	Signature = bit string representation of document terms; used to speed up approximate search.
