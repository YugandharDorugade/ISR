🧩 EXPERIMENT 1 — Conflation Algorithm
🧠 Aim
To implement a Conflation Algorithm using file handling.

🎯 Objectives
Understand how text documents are represented in information retrieval.
Learn how to reduce words to their common roots (stems) for efficient indexing.
Observe how stop words, suffixes, and equivalent stems affect retrieval accuracy and storage.

🧩 Core Theory (Concepts You Must Know for Viva)
1️⃣ Document Representation
A document representative is how a system views a document — not as full text but as a list of meaningful words (index terms).
There are 3 levels of representation:
Type	Description	Example
Full Text	Every word of the document	“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
Reduced Text	Removes stop words (like ‘the’, ‘is’)	“quick brown fox jumps lazy dog”
Keyword View	Extracts only meaningful root terms	“quick”, “brown”, “fox”, “jump”, “lazy”, “dog”

So, instead of processing 10,000 words, we work with maybe 1,000 index terms.

2️⃣ Conflation Algorithm
Used in Information Retrieval (IR) to merge (or conflate) words with similar meanings/forms into a single representative form called the stem.

📘 Example:
“connect”, “connected”, “connecting”, “connection” → connect
This makes searching and indexing faster and more relevant.

3️⃣ Steps in Conflation Algorithm
(a) Removal of High-Frequency Words (Stop Words)
Stop words = common meaningless words like the, and, of, to, is.
Removed using a stop list.
Benefit: reduces file size by ~30–50% and increases relevance.

(b) Suffix Stripping
Removes suffixes (like ing, ed, ion, s, ly) to get word roots.
Must follow context rules to avoid errors:
The remaining stem must have minimum length (e.g., >2 characters)
Avoid false removals (e.g., remove ual from factual but not from equal)

(c) Detecting Equivalent Stems
Groups stems that are morphologically equivalent.
Example: absorb ↔ absorpt because b and pt are treated as equivalent endings.
Final output:
Each stem represents a class of equivalent words.
Each document is represented by the set of class names (keywords) that appear in it.

4️⃣ Why Use Conflation
Reduces redundancy.
Improves recall (finds more relevant docs).
Saves space.
Helps in automatic indexing and clustering.

5️⃣ Limitations
-Over-stemming (different meanings merge incorrectly).
Example: “neutron” and “neutralize”.
-Under-stemming (different forms not merged).
Example: “analysis” and “analyze”.
Still, conflation improves retrieval effectiveness overall.

⚙️ Simplified Implementation Idea (C / C++ / Python Pseudocode)
Let’s imagine we have a text file named input.txt.

# Step 1: Read text
text = open("input.txt").read().lower()

# Step 2: Remove stop words
stop_words = ["the", "is", "a", "an", "and", "of", "to"]
words = [w for w in text.split() if w not in stop_words]

# Step 3: Basic suffix stripping
stems = []
for w in words:
    for suf in ["ing", "ed", "ly", "s", "ion"]:
        if w.endswith(suf) and len(w) > len(suf)+2:
            w = w[: -len(suf)]
            break
    stems.append(w)

# Step 4: Create equivalent classes (simplified)
unique_stems = sorted(set(stems))
print("Document Representative:", unique_stems)

This outputs the representative terms for the document.

💬 Short Answer Questions (From Manual)
Q1. Explain working of Conflation Algorithm.
Ans:
Conflation algorithm merges words with similar meanings or roots into one stem by:
Removing high-frequency (stop) words.
Stripping suffixes to get base words.
Detecting equivalent stems to form a single representative class.
Each document is represented by a set of class names or stems.

Q2. State and Explain Luhn’s Theory.
Ans:
Proposed by Hans Peter Luhn (1958).
States that significant words in a document are the ones occurring neither too frequently nor too rarely.
These words carry the most meaning for document retrieval.
So, IR systems should focus on medium-frequency words for indexing.

🎤 Viva Questions (With Answers)
No.	Question							Short Answer
1	Difference between Data Retrieval and Information Retrieval	Data retrieval = exact match queries (e.g., SQL). Information retrieval = searching relevant documents by content (e.g., Google search).
2	Indexing Exhaustively vs. Specificity				Exhaustive = include all possible terms; Specific = include only precise, relevant terms.
3	Five commonly used measures of association in IR		Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient, Dice coefficient, Overlap coefficient, Simple matching coefficient.
4	Why use normalized versions of simple matching coefficient?	To make similarity independent of document length and scale, ensuring fair comparison.




----------------------------QNA-----------------------------------------
- Data Retrieval vs Information Retrieval:
Data Retrieval gets exact data matches (e.g., in databases).
Information Retrieval finds relevant information based on meaning or context (e.g., search engines).

- Indexing Exhaustivity vs Specificity:
Exhaustivity = how completely document concepts are covered by index terms.
Specificity = how precisely index terms represent the document’s topic.

- Five Common Measures of Association in IR:
Jaccard Coefficient
Dice Coefficient
Cosine Similarity
Overlap Coefficient
Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient

- Why Use Normalized Simple Matching Coefficient:
Normalization removes bias from document length or term frequency differences, allowing fairer similarity comparison.

- Stems, Index Terms, Measures of Association:
Stems: Root forms of words obtained after removing prefixes/suffixes (e.g., “computing,” “computer” → “comput”).
Index Terms: Keywords or descriptors used to represent document content in an index.
Measures of Association: Mathematical formulas that quantify the similarity or relationship between terms or documents.

- Data Retrieval vs Information: Data retrieval fetches raw data, while information retrieval focuses on extracting meaningful and relevant information from data.

- Indexing Exhaustivity and Specificity: Exhaustivity measures how completely a document’s content is indexed; specificity measures how precisely the index terms describe the content.

- Five Measures of Association: Jaccard coefficient, Dice coefficient, Cosine similarity, Overlap coefficient, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

- Normalized Coefficients: Normalization adjusts for differences in data size or feature counts, ensuring fair comparison between documents or queries.
